This repository contains the *developer and API* documentation for Spyder, the Scientific Python Development Environment.
You can view the live dev docs for current and past Spyder versions at [Spyder-IDE.GitHub.io/Spyder-API-Docs](https://spyder-ide.github.io/spyder-api-docs/).

For Spyder's *user* documentation, visit the [``spyder-ide/spyder-docs`` repository](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder-docs) or the deployed documentation at [docs.spyder-ide.org](https://docs.spyder-ide.org/).
For more information about Spyder itself, please see our [website](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) and the [main repo](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder).


## Building and Running

This project uses [Nox](https://nox.thea.codes/) to help automate setting up an environment, building and running, linting the codebase, and many other development tasks.
To build it, ensure Nox is installed (via pip, Conda, pipx, etc), and then just run

```shell
nox -s build
```

For more details and step by step instructions, see our [Contributing Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

Its easy to build a local copy in one or two steps with Nox, or you can also just check your changes with our automated CI jobs on PRs.
Just submit a PR with your changes and we'll be happy to review it; make sure to read our [Contributing Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) first to ensure the process of getting your revisions integrated goes smoothly.
